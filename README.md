TimePix raw file loading in Python

Requires:
* Boost 1.52
* SoPhy (from Amsterdam Scientific) copied in this directory (or modify sophy_include in setup.py)
  This path should have a subdirectory sophy/lib/common with common.h, asitypes.h, etc. in it.
* libmpxhwrelaxd.a (linux-x86_64) from Amsterdam Scientific in this directory (I don't have the rights to distribute it)
* Cython
* libtiff-dev
